CoolQ Telegram Bot X is a message forwarding bot. This bot can help to forward messages from one [QQ](https://im.qq.com) / [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group to another. With simple config, you can customize the forwarding logic in a convenient way. Feel free to link between QQ and Telegram, or merge different messages to one place.

## Features

#### Deep Integration

CoolQ Telegram Bot X is an integration of QQ Bot and Telegram Bot. **[CoolQ](https://cqp.cc/) Message SDK** ensures the stability and availability of receiving and sending QQ messages every time. **Telegram C++ SDK** based on official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) shows its power to handle different kinds of messages. Forwarding logic unit will parse and transfer messages which QQ Bot or Telegram Bot receive to another group according to forward config.

All message SDKs and forwarding logic unit are packed into a **CoolQ plugin**. Start CoolQ, enable the plugin, and enjoy :)

#### Multi-direction Forwarding

CoolQ Telegram Bot X supports various forwarding type. No matter **QQ to Telegram**, or **Telegram to QQ**, it can parse and transfer messages correctly. Besides, **QQ to QQ** and **Telegram to Telegram** message forwarding can help you organize and merge messages from different groups.

In some cases, you may need one-direction forwarding rather than bi-direction forwarding. Don't worry, CoolQ Telegram Bot X is still capable to do it.

#### Smart Message Conversion

You may notice that QQ faces are special characters. CoolQ Telegram Bot X is so smart, converting QQ faces to emoji automatically when sending to Telegram group. In future work, we will support more special message conversion.
