CoolQ Telegram Bot X is a message forwarding bot. This bot can help to forward messages from one [QQ](https://im.qq.com) / [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) group to another. With simple config, you can customize the forwarding logic in a convenient way. Feel free to link between QQ and Telegram, or merge different messages to one place.

## Features

#### Deep Integration

CoolQ Telegram Bot X is an integration of QQ Bot and Telegram Bot. **[CoolQ](https://cqp.cc/) Message SDK** ensures the stability and availability of receiving and sending QQ messages every time. **Telegram C++ SDK** based on official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) shows its power to handle different kinds of messages.

All message SDKs and forwarding logic unit are packed into a **CoolQ plugin**. Start CoolQ, enable the plugin, and enjoy :)

#### Multi-direction Forwarding

CoolQ Telegram Bot X supports various forwarding type. No matter **QQ to Telegram**, or **Telegram to QQ**, it can parse and transfer messages correctly. Besides, **QQ to QQ** and **Telegram to Telegram** message forwarding can help you organize and merge messages from different groups.

In some cases, you may need one-direction forwarding rather than bi-direction forwarding. Don't worry, CoolQ Telegram Bot X is still capable to do it.

#### Smart Message Conversion

You may notice that QQ faces are special characters. CoolQ Telegram Bot X is so smart, converting QQ faces to emoji automatically when sending to Telegram group. In future work, we will support more special message conversion.
